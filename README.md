# electro-dev-serv
NPM's Live-Server packaged as a native app... with Electron!

Build me with `npm run make`, then pass me around to HTML/CSS learners so they can have all the glory of live-server now as they learn the developming arts.

They can learn all that boring node.js dependency stuff later.
